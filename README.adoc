Change the log level of java.util.logging loggers at runtime.


What is LogLevelChanger
-----------------------

LogLevelChanger is a small CLI program for adjusting the java.util.logging
log levels of a process at runtime.

Other logging libraries already provide a way to modify the log levels at
runtime by rereading the logging configuration or maybe by other means, but
java.util.logging does not provide such a functionality out of the
box.footnote:[It is already possible by means of JMX, e.g. via JConsole.
This approach is actually used by LogLevelChanger.]


Prerequisites
-------------

LogLevelChanger can be used with Java 6 to 8, but is not compatible with
Java 9 or higher.

As LogLevelChanger uses the tools.jar provided by the JDK an installation
of the JDK must be available.


Installation
------------

LogLevelChanger is provided as a zipfile or tarball at the
{download-page}[Download page]. These contain the jar file and a shell
script to run it. The shell script is only provided for Unix-like systems
at the moment. Expand of these archives to a directory of your choice.


Usage
-----

Run LogLevelChanger via the provided shell script.
Without any parameters it provides a usage note and exits.

SYNOPSIS
       LogLevelChanger PID  [LOGGER [LOGLEVEL]]

DESCRIPTION
       Prints or changes the LogLevels of Loggers of a Java process.
       Without any arguments (apart from the PID), it prints all the
       loggers and their configured LogLevels.
       If only the LOGGER is given, it prints out the LogLevel of that
       Logger.
       If both, the LOGGER and the LOGLEVEL are given, it sets the
       LogLevel of the given Logger.

PARAMETERS
       PID
               The PID of the process for which to print or change the LogLevels.

       LOGGER
               The name of the Logger to print or the change the LogLevel of.

       LOGLEVEL
               The log level to set for the given Logger.
